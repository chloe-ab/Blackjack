			The rules are the regular rules of blackjack; the dealer deals a card to both the user and the dealer, and then the user chooses whether to hit or stay.<br/><br/>
			If the total sum value of cards in the user's or dealer's hand exceeds 21, they lose.<br/>
			Whoever has the highest sum value of cards in their hand that is less than or equal to 21 wins.<br/>
